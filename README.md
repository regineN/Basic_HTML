<h1>Basic HTML and HTML5</h1>
<p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language used to describe the structure of a web page</p>
<p>It uses a special syntax or notation to organize and give information about the page to the browser</p>
<p>Elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content</p>
<p>For example, there are different tag options to place around text to show whether it is a heading, a paragraph, or a list.</p>
<p>The HyperText part of HTML comes from the early days of the web and its original use case</p>
<p>Pages usually contained static documents that contained references to other documents.</p>
<p>These references contained hypertext links used by the browser to navigate to the reference document so the user could read the reference document without having to manually search for it.</p>
<p>As web pages and web applications grow more complex, the W3 Consortium updates the HTML specification to ensure that a webpage can be shown reliably on any browser. The latest version of HTML is HTML5.</p>
